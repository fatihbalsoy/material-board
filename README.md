The Material Dashboard plugin for WordPress updates the appearance of your site's dashboard to a sleeker, more contemporary design based on [Google's Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/design). This plugin preserves your existing dashboard layout, avoids making any significant alterations, and doesn't include any branding or promotional content. It's straightforward to use and comes at no cost.
