Material Design (codenamed Quantum Paper) is a design language developed in 2014 by 
Google. Expanding upon the "card" motifs that debuted in Google Now, Material Design makes 
more liberal use of grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and 
depth effects such as lighting and shadows. - Wikipedia
